We want to use three.js, and have some support or think of from start we might want to make many different 3d objects so thats easy to start a new one, some objects will be done prodecurally with thee.js code some might be meshes, use vite and ts"}}

Add new objects by creating a file and one line in the registry.\n- **Side-on camera** that auto-fits to any object's bounding box, orbits at 8 × 45° intervals.\n- **Live preview** with OrbitControls for inspection, dropdown to switch objects, export button.\n- **Sprite sheet** output as a horizontal strip PNG (8 frames), configurable resolution per frame.\n- **Example object** - a simple procedural cart (box + cylinder wheels) to demonstrate the system.\n\n8 implementation steps, starting from project scaffolding through wiring everything together."}}
