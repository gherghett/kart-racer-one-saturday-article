This will be from a top down perspective the track itself. this data will be able to be saved just like the kartsprites to the paretn dir, and read from the game, and used. We might want to be able to place the start/finish line aswell, and populate with checkpoints, just numbered points that the game can use to know the direction of the map. And then well have a heightmap mode for the drawing where we like can heighten or lower the map with a brush. so basically the map is a bucnch of 2d images, that the game understands"}}
